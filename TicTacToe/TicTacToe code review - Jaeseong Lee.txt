/*CS520 - Code review and MVC in action - Jaeseong Lee*/


******How to run******
1.Run `ant` in the root directory, which contains the `build.xml` build file.
2.Run `java -cp bin Main`


******Code Review******
	The Controller's role in the MVC pattern is to adjust the View and the Model.
Therefore, It must also be able to invoke methods of the model to manipulate the data
or invoke operations.
	The provided TicTacToe program was not separated the logic from the user
interface, so the View part of the program or the logic running behind it cannot be
easily modified without affecting each other. Therefore, the controller must
be modified to manipulate the domain model in response to GUI-based events.
This problem can be addressed by changing the structure so that the user's request
through the interface can communicate with the model through the controller.
	Too many redundant patterns in Model. (Too many duplicated loops for checking
each row, col, diagonal on the board and unnecessary duplicated state messages).
Need to create the methods involved in the logic, create the necessary objects using
the controller, and render them to the view.

******Redesign list******
1. Controller invokes methods responding to logic from Model

2. Controller renders(view data) to View.

3. Model and View can't call the method and variables directly from each other

4. Redisign method to determine a winner in each game

(there was a bug from provided code i.g If the user presses the buttons in order
[2][0]-'X', [2][1]-'O', [1][0]-'X', [1][1]-'O', [0][0]-'X', the game ends and
player 1 wins to be normal, but it is ignored and the user can continue pressing the button
and the winner can also be changed.).
To solve this bug, I used the for loop to check rows, columns, and diagonal lines.

5. Reading game moves from the command line.
C:\Users\JasonLee\Desktop\TicTacToe\TicTacToe>java -cp bin Main
(New Game!
Player 1('X') Marked point(3,1). now Player 2('O')'s turn
Player 2('O') Marked point(3,2). now Player 1('X')'s turn
Player 1('X') Marked point(2,1). now Player 2('O')'s turn
Player 2('O') Marked point(2,3). now Player 1('X')'s turn
Player 1('X') Marked point(2,2). now Player 2('O')'s turn
